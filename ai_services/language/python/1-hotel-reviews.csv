575499706,VCBCX1,4/24/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"This XT property definitely meets my expectations for a full service hotel as facility is well maintained and the employees are extremely courteous and attentive.  The room was pleasant and for me was a two room suite.  The master bed had its own door for privacy and the bathroom is accessible by both rooms via a single door.  There was plenty of room to relax with a hide-away sofa and the desk was well lit for work.  A simple service bar is available with complimentary coffee/tea and a wine refrigerator.  The view I had was shared by the Executive lounge which overlooks the Crystal Mall.  If you're into sushi, there are two incredible places just across the street, as well as an Earl's and other fine dining.  It was close to where I needed to be so it was not only comfortable but convenient as well.  I have already returned to this property and hope to stay again when I return for more business."
477003835,VCBCX1,4/18/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"One night in Vancouver when we visited our son who goes to college there. I ravel a lot and stay in many hotels. The service at The Vancouver XT Metrotown was courteous and efficient. The 11th floor room was nicely appointed, spotlessly clean, and smelled fresh. The elevators actually go nice and quickly, which is a bonus on the 11th floor. Bed was comfy. Everyone was so friendly. Even the cleaning staff were full of smiles and wishing us a good morning.This makes a big difference! But best of all was the restaurant. We just had one meal there (dinner). The food was excellent (my wife has chicken and I had fish). The service was spectacular - our server was deligtfuland really on the ball (I forget her name, but she was from the Czech Republic Republic). She really looked after us. Overall an excellent stay and I highly recommend this hotel. It's a people business and these folk get it!"
488584133,VCBCX1,5/28/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"My vehicle was parked in underground hotel parkade during my 3 day stay there.  My vehicle was broken into shortly after I checked-in. The hotel asked if I was in valet parking - I was right beside it.  But no security cameras caught the break-in.  There was no electronic gate at the entrance or exit.  Very bad security!  I lost approximately $800 in valuables including prescription medication.  I asked if the hotel would pay the deductible for the broken window and locks.  I was told the XT did not own the parkade and that there were signs advising that it was not responsible for vehicle break-ins.  Other than that, I found the staff quite friendly and the accomodation quite nice.  The $30 I paid for my daughter's breakfast buffet was a little steep!"
242843543,VCBCX1,12/3/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Vancouver was a significant stop on a 5 week road trip from Jackson, Wyoming, ending in Northern California.  To reduce expenses, I booked this hotel using XT points.  Although the hotel is not in downtown Vancouver, it was an easy train ride into town.  Our room was upgraded, and we had a separate bedroom and living area.  As a result, my friend had to sleep on a sleeper sofa which wasn't the most comfortable.  The extra space was helpful, but her sleeping arrangements weren't ideal.  The hotel staff is friendly and provided good directions to the train station and local transportation.  When driving it, it took us quite some time to find the hotel even with GPS, and traffic was horrific."
288729010,VCBCX1,7/13/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"The best cost benefit for a family of four with an excellent location in Vancouver: public transportation, variety of good restaurants and a shoping mall at one block, plus an outstanding service from all employees of the hotel. My wife, two teen kids and I, comfortable in the same suite, it is possible at this unique XT. Despite some minor issues like: no microwave in the room, no breakfast family package, no shuttle to anywhere, which i would firmly suggest to XT of considering these easy improvements to gain the excellent, as the experience for staying for a long period is, so far, totally acceptable without suffering."
296762201,VCBCX1,8/7/2015,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed 6 nights at this hotel a little bit further than Vancouver. It is a five minute walk away from the Metropolis Metrotown shopping mall and across the street from a supermarket and drugstore. The neighborhood is under construction but once inside the hotel you enjoy a quiet atmosphere and luxurious large rooms. Prefer to stay at a high level for enjoying the view to the buildings and mountains. We definitely recommand this hotel if you have a car to drive to Granville Island or Vancouver. Selfparking is available  for a fee but you can choose valet parking alternatively. We enjoyed free wifi.
168480110,VCBCX1,7/21/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"Being a XT Diamond member for many years, to say I have many points of reference is redundant. This is one of those XT's which is a standout. the location is great; adjacent to Metrotown and SkyTrain. The executive lounge staff is top-notch and include Jennifer and Candace. The two ladies and very polite, professional, friendly and efficient. I could have easily stayed closer to my work, but found this XT my preference even if I had to take a taxi to and from work every day. I believe I stayed here at least 8 different weeks over a couple of years and will whenever I do visit again."
627361020,VCBCX1,10/22/2018,Vancouver X Inn,It was a first visit to Vancouver for a 3 day event held at this hotel. Every employee we encountered was intent on making sure our stay was comfortable and stress free.  The food was delicious both in the restaurant and at our event.  Our beds were comfortable and made up fresh every day. Especially appreciated were the manager and chef that came running to help with a nasty glue gun burn during prep for the event. That chef even checked on me during lunch the next day.  This hotel made an unforgettable event even better. Let's hope the Hearties use them again next year. â¤ï¸
422826413,VCBCX1,9/27/2016,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed three days pre cruise on route to Alaska and one day post cruise on return. The hotel is well positioned for the sky train for exploring down town with the usual comforts you expect from the XT brand. We were travelling with our two friends who like ourselves noted the friendly helpful manner of the staff. Sometimes in a big organisation this can be the hardest area to get right. But as we say in Scotland everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet and the staff from the doormen breakfast and bar staff to the reception were exceptional. Great chat and good fun.
558030698,VCBCX1,2/2/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had picked it due to its location near the skytrain. However despite being a XT Honors member and using 30,000 points we were given a different room to what we booked and it overlooked a noisy very large construction area. Very disappointing after a 14 hr plane trip! It was also near a very noisy ice machine - staff made no effort to discuss while we were there and to reconcile. Despite this beds were comfortable and food in restaurant in hotel was very good. The hotel lacks atmosphere though - needs a makeover. "
188227404,VCBCX1,12/21/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"This was our first trip ti Vancouver (and Canada). This hotel is about a 20 minute train trip from the city center and water front but the train station is just a street or two away from the hotel, there is also a bus station nearby if you fancy a bus trip into town! There is a supermarket, a huge shopping center and lot of restaurants very close by too. To me, it seemed to be a area dominated by Asian shops and foods, which was wonderful! The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was great and kept spotless while we were there."
603130672,VCBCX1,8/5/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent location, within walking distance from the Metro station, Metropolis mall, Pricesmart grocery store and Halal food whih is located right behind the hotel.The Filipino lady at the front desk (apologies I forgot her name) was very professional and kind. Mr.Raju at the conceirge was knowlegable and professional and helped us plan our activities.Ronaldo Santos the Bell man was helpful and extremely kind to my kids.The hotel room I stayed in was at the 14th floor, it was clean and nice. I would definitely stay there again."
632946445,VCBCX1,11/12/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"The entire staff was excellent and went beyond expectations. My companion became ill and they went out of their way to make her feel better. The manager went as far as going out to get pain medication for her and having a microwave brought to our room. With service like this, we will continue to come back each year. The location has access to a great balance of city vibe and neighborhood feel. There is so much you can walk to if you are interested in taking scenic excursions. I have no complaints whatsoever."
493689401,VCBCX1,6/17/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"It's 3.15am in the morning, I have two young babies and no CRIBS are available it's pure and utter torture we have had no sleep even though I called ahead before and requested them. Just told to sleep with them in bed which is impossible and unsafe with two of them. This is a night from hell. This is disgraceful and totally unfair. Hotel of bloody torture this is. Will never ever be staying here again. If you have children don't stay here your more than likely won't get a crib! Beware!!!"
427724843,VCBCX1,10/13/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Vancouver has a lot of hotels - The XT Metrotown is a great hotel for business travelers.   It's a full service hotel and it has all of the amenities and services that you need.   Personally, I like it because of its location - I can easily drive to job sites - and if I want to go downtown, Translink station is close by.This is not the newest property but it's well maintained and nice and clean.   Staff are very friendly and helpful and speak multiple languages."
357298156,VCBCX1,3/21/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for just one weekend.  We never did use the internet, gym or pool. As we were too busy with friends and family.  But the view was nice, staff were great, room was very clean.  My husband and I would definitely stay there again. The location perfect; we could walk to shopping or restaurants, and use the sky train to get downtown. We do not like to drive much in Vancouver, so we left our car in the underground parking- which was extra, but worth it."
207977422,VCBCX1,5/29/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"The rooms are spacious, immaculate and the bed is luxurious.  The hotel was very quiet and the restaurant has an extensive buffet.   Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Burnaby.  Below the hotel is the delightful Crystal Mall which is an Asian Shopping Mall and across the street is a beautiful park.  Within a short block is the Metro Mall which is fantastic and offers all high brand name stores.  The location of this hotel cannot be matched!!"
542125603,VCBCX1,11/19/2017,Vancouver X Inn,This is the second year we have stayed at this hotel because of an event we attend. It is kind of an expensive hotel with expensive parking charges. We have never eaten in the hotel as there are a lot of less expensive alternatives for meals close by. If we did not get a group rate we would probably look for a less expensive alternative.  One thing to note - the beds seem kind of hard. By the third of the 6 nights we were there it was getting uncomfortable.
210704268,VCBCX1,6/17/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"why stay downtown when you can beat congestion by staying here? easy to reach all downtown activities n Richmond. located next to a mall with great Asian cuisine food court. disappointed in the small pool n spa size, though n the fact that its difficult to reach (definitely Not handicap accessible!).  but room was large, beds comfortable, view wonderful. parking is an extra $11.00/night charge, though.  really??? Why? breakfast buffet was great, but pricey."
460176110,VCBCX1,2/15/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"We would like to commend your staff Eddie. We booked 4 rooms next to each other on the 8th floor as we were all from out of town and went to Vancouver to attend a friend's funeral. On our last night, feb11,  we ordered soda to be brought to our room. When he learned we were having a get together to celebrate memories of our friend's life, he brought us plates, forks, chips and nuts! We were surprised and deeply touched with the gesture. Thank you Eddie!"
274211719,VCBCX1,5/24/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"No need to pay exorbitant Vancouver downtown prices. This hotel worked out well for us. We got the King suite and was perfect for 2 adults and 2 kids. Hotel and rooms were very clean, staff friendly and helpful. Metrotown Skytrain station just 5 min walk away so very easy and reasonably priced to get to and from Vancouver downtown. Chinese food court of the adjacent Crystal Mall accessible from the 2nd floor with great Chinese and Malaysian options."
640437177,VCBCX1,12/18/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed in this XT many times and it never disappoints, it is likely my favorite XT property.  There are a number of good restaurants within walking distance, although the food and service at the in house restaurant and bar normally keep me here.  If you want to head downtown the sky train is only a block away, it's about a 20 min ride.  For exercise, Central Park is a quick walk and offers a great trail and 5k path for a jog."
528619112,VCBCX1,9/30/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is not in downtown, but it is very close to the sky train, that takes you to downtown in about half hour. It is also close to the Metrotown bus stand, where I got off when I came from Victoria by the ferry and then by bus. The metrotown mall is at the bus stand, 2 mins walking distance from the hotel, so there are lots of eating options here as well in the mallâ€™s food court. In that way, XT Metrotown is very well connected."
176000655,VCBCX1,9/5/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"I've been travelling to the Metrotown XT for over 4 years, monthly, for business purposes and have had consistent, professional, kind and caring service from each and every staff, every visit. They know their jobs, always go the extra mile, are friendly, kind and sincere. They truly enjoy making every guests' stay comfortable and worry free. I know this because of how I am treated and how I see them treat other guests. Like family!"
397457911,VCBCX1,7/25/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel has everything you need plus the nicest staff.  My key stopped working in the elevator and, the second time resetting it, the gentleman at the check-in counter came out to the elevator to try it himself.  He made sure I didn't have any problems.  As a woman often travelling alone, I felt very safe and comfortable.  Windows don't let a hint of outdoor sound in - totally quiet even with all the construction in the area."
497789391,VCBCX1,7/1/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here using XT Honors points. The hotel is about 20 minutes outside of downtown Vancouver next to the enormous Metropolis Mall. The sky train is one block away and it will zip you into downtown. The hotel is comfortable, the room was clean and the service was really friendly and accommodating. The food is pricey, but in line for Vancouver (the 3rd most expensive city in the world). Had a nice five night stay."
333416739,VCBCX1,12/16/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"I travel 40 weeks out of the year and have been a loyal XT guest for many, many years. Of all the XT brand hotels, this is my favorite. It has been two years or so since my last visit and it is still great. The staff, especially Jennifer in the Opal lounge are superb. Walking distance to Metrotown and Skytrain are added bonuses. Thank you for making my business trip relaxing and comfortable once again."
609668219,VCBCX1,8/23/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"Room was a King bed  delux on the 9th floor. Separate bedroom from living area. Clean, comfortable bed. Spent 3 nights on business - desk was well organized for laptop and plugs for charging to do work. Room was cleaned daily - friendly staff. Just sorry I missed the bbq on the rooftop thursday evenings. Hotel was a 5 minute walk to Metrotown tower I and II and the sky train. Definitely recommend"
169110677,VCBCX1,7/25/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff were always welcoming, helpful and happy.  The hotel is perfectly situated for shopping, getting downtown by SkyTrain and having a suite for less than paying downtown prices.  The hidden secret is that it is attached to Crystal Mall that has amazing and authentic Asian food for a very affordable price.  With a kids and adult pool, it made it very nice for everyone to get what they wanted."
393351174,VCBCX1,7/16/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Prices were very high, for a &quot;days inn motel&quot; experience. Quite basic, somewhere to sleep essentially. The pool is  a &quot;lap pool&quot;; enough for two people and the hot tub that was &quot;warm&quot; probably fit around 3 people. Not even a complimentary breakfast, $21.00 for the buffet, how tragic. However very good location, close to mall, skytrain, and food. Would not come back."
632366990,VCBCX1,11/10/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"We found this hotel perfect for a weekend getaway. It's close to Metrotown shopping center and to the Crystal Mall. Crystal mall for those that dont know is Asian focused; it's a great for food,farmers market, and herbal medicines. So many restaurants to dine  near by the hotel. Valet parking reasonable. The hotel bar/lounge and dining were clean, comfortable and relaxing. We'll be back."
428828920,VCBCX1,10/17/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is located in a great area, especially if you are using public transit. Not the best for visitors with a vehicle, especially large SUV/Trucks. Parking is difficult at best. The hotel has been around now for 10+ years and starting to look a bit dated, the interior needs refreshing. Lot's of amenities nearby with in walking distance since the shopping mall is next door."
590955849,VCBCX1,6/26/2018,Vancouver X Inn,Really a super location to avoid the downtown Vancouver madness while still maintaining proximity. Right on the SkyTrain line with the metrotown station only a block from the hotel makes it super easy to go downtown. Hotel is clean and modern. Pool is small but it has a hot tub as well. A decent small gym which has a massive well appointed good life fitness across the street.
234877435,VCBCX1,10/17/2014,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is centrally located to the downtown area and the airport with great views of the Mountains.  The staff was all very nice and my room was very clean.  As a Diamond member you are granted access to the penthouse suite where you can eat and relax and view the city.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again the next time I am in Vancouver.
517856154,VCBCX1,8/26/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel great service, friendly, helpful staff throughout the hotel including Reflect Lounge. We stay here once every six months for three days. The staff always remember us and go out if there way to make us feel welcomed. The most accommodating staff! Very happy with this hotel!  Thank you Colin, Cecilia, Steve, Adam, Jose x 2, and Marlene. Holly and Sharon"
579049860,VCBCX1,5/9/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"I always stay with XT so it was a no brainer for me to book at this hotel. Service was excellent! I had a gorgeous view of the North Shore Mountains from my 12th floor room my room itself was nowhere near worth what I paid for it. The furniture was old, worn out and frayed. Everything except the linens, mattress and TVs very much need replacing and/or updating."
208635401,VCBCX1,6/2/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"the room is clean and big enough. Considering it is XT the price is also attractive. However I think it should be equipped with free parking and free internet which is not. Maybe it is my fault not to check the parking police in advance(I think it will be free parking as all the other hotels I stay in Canada), so I was surprise to pay for the parking fee."
638393123,VCBCX1,12/9/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"Had rate issues with hotel. Hotel would not honor reserved rates. Diamond desk was very uncooperative. It will be a pleaseure to stay somewhere elese. Property if good, but XT's rate practices are unacceptable. There are no advantages to being diamond member beyond what our corporate rate offers. XT does not appreciate value of Diamond members. "
498666431,VCBCX1,7/4/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"There aren't too many XT properties in Vancouver, considering its size, but I chose this one because of its location to downtown, price and the reviews that I saw on it.  I wasn't disappointed.  The rooms were very nice and clean.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely stay here again the next time that I am in Vancouver."
207777008,VCBCX1,5/28/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at the XT recently and found this hotel really went above and beyond anything we have experienced in other top rated hotels.  The staff seem genuine and caring and were always so nice to deal with.  The restaurant staff were top notch, and the house keepers were cheerful and very good at their job. Overall a pleasant experience."
482932378,VCBCX1,5/8/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"I was very pleased with my recent stay at the XT Vancouver; a very comfortable room with high end toiletries, friendly and helpful staff, and a well-run moderately priced restaurant.  It is easily accessible to all tourist and business destinations via the metro.  I will definitely stay at this hotel again upon my next trip to Vancouver."
312543845,VCBCX1,9/21/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"The service here was unobtrusive, but helpful and friendly when we asked for anything.While it was out of the centre of the city the cheap public transport was close and made getting around easy and convenient.  We didn't realize how close we were to Metrotown Mall when we booked so it was an added bonus.The I room fridge was an added"
174596769,VCBCX1,8/28/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"The pool and hottub were broken and when they were fixed, did not work properly. The pool was warmer then the hottub and the staff was unhelpful. The breakfast only goes until 9. Not family friendly and highly do not recommend this hotel. Any hotel in Vancouver and Burnaby would be better then this, at best, 2 star hotel."
204398465,VCBCX1,5/6/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed for work so we didn't spend much time in the rooms, but they were clean and large. The staff were very helpful and attentive. The gym facilities are sparse and uninspiring, but the amenities were there. The roof top pool was nice and quiet for the most part. Proximity to the skyrail, metrotown station was key."
207760940,VCBCX1,5/28/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"I didn't expect much as this is not in Vancouver and I paid around 130$ per night. As I started going around the area and took the sky train, I realized the location of the hotel was perfect. The bed was pretty comfortable and the room size was big enough also. If you need to be in this area, I do recommend this hotel."
224912279,VCBCX1,8/27/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband had a business trip to Vancouver, so the kids and I tagged along. The hotel was at a very convenient location, especially if you want some good Chinese food. The second floor of the hotel connects to Crystal Mall--a collection of Asian stores and food stands. We had a good time walking around there."
161292001,VCBCX1,5/15/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"I was impressed at the  quaility of the resort, faulous lines on the baeds, which were amazinglt comfortable. WE had fabulous service, cleanliness is fantastic, food in executive loungs  great, views great .Location  is amazing next to Metrotown,  the largest Mall in BC, and a bonus of chinese mall next door."
458791677,VCBCX1,2/11/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"Rooms are always clean and comfortable, they're probably due for an upgrade. They're quite large, which is also nice, I find newer hotels have ridiculously time rooms. Great location - right across from Metrotown! Shopping!! The best part about this hotel is the staff, they're incredibly friendly and helpful."
570882991,VCBCX1,4/3/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"We chose this hotel due to its location near Skytrain, Metrotown, and a park. It did not disappoint, and hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. They were in the midst of a few repairs and maintenance to the building which is understandable, and can only mean it will be better when you stay there.  "
177975723,VCBCX1,9/20/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"When visiting Vancouver BC this is the perfect central location hotel to stay. Everyone is friendly and at your service to make the experience worth coming. We will come back. Helped us in places to go and see and the hotel is safe and very comfortable, great pool, friendly staff at the Bar and good food."
302247487,VCBCX1,8/22/2015,Vancouver X Inn,I stay at the XT regularly for business trips and the staff are always friendly and helpful. Facilities in the hotel are great and there are lots of restaurants and other places around the area. I especially like the outdoor pool (even in winter) and the rooms on the corner with windows on two sides.
342467983,VCBCX1,1/24/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Booked thru travelzoo because was a better deal than thru hotel itself ! Was told when booked thru hotel would be best deal and would honour any deals and match ! Well they didn't and so booked thru travelzoo at a great saving , hotel was fine  nothing special , strange room for 1 bedroom suite but ok "
170168678,VCBCX1,5/31/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"I was very pleased with the service and cleanliness of this hotel.  There were staff available for great service, and they were very helpful.  I will return to this hotel when visiting Vancouver.  Being near the SkyTrain and Metrotown makes it a great location.  There is also a park across the street."
567574127,VCBCX1,3/19/2018,Vancouver X Inn,Me and my girlfriend stayed here for one night and she did not want to leave the staff were amazing and the room was excellent I would definitely stay in this hotel next time I travel. Only issue I found was the tub was very slippery felt very unsafe taking a shower would recommend rubber foot pads
236355770,VCBCX1,10/26/2014,Vancouver X Inn,Always enjoy staying here. Great service. Use the valet parking- worth the extra cost. Room was near the elevator so was quite noisy. Pillows way too soft so with the noise didn't sleep really well. Great banquet with our event. This is a good horel. Would have been 5 stars if it hadn't been noisy.
252187876,VCBCX1,2/1/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"pool hot tub fitness center VERY small and disappointing. paid for executive rate and executive lounge was closed upon arrival, found out later staff had failed to give me coupon for appy's in hotel lounge. Requested to get regular rate and opt out of executive rate and was refused by manager."
473708167,VCBCX1,4/8/2017,Vancouver X Inn,The main issue is that this hotel doesn't have its own designated parking lot so you must struggle getting through a parking lot shared by the mall.  So if your not in a car the hotel is fine. Nice views etc... but if you have a car be prepared to be frustrated on weekends and afternoons. 
245200654,VCBCX1,12/19/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel with very friendly staff. The check in process was very fast and convienent The rooms were clean, the lobby inviting and breakfast was great. The beds made for a very comfortable stay. Highly recommend this hotel to others to stay at. I will be staying at this hotel again."
402667991,VCBCX1,8/7/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"excellent family stay. subway near hotel is great bonus- 25 min to downtown. We took CAA package and enjoyed very good breakfast included to the price. We recommend to use e-check in, we had option to choose our room and floor using hotel's room map.  highly recommenced for any occasion."
414735816,VCBCX1,9/4/2016,Vancouver X Inn,We booked a room for 2 nights. One of those nights was not available. The staff upgraded us for free. Top floor beautiful view even tho there was lots of construction. Super friendly staff. The pool and hot tub need some major upgrading. Love how close metro shopping was. Great stay! 
188637757,VCBCX1,12/26/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"Believe me when I attest that each and every staff member you will encounter here are not only efficient and professional, but warm, friendly, kind and caring. They are genuine folks who always go out of their way to treat me and every guest like gold! They are wonderful people!!!"
234325884,VCBCX1,10/14/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"I've been in this hotel from OCT 9th to 13th for an AIESEC regional conference. It was simply amazing, great servicing, nice rooms, very friendly and kind staff and the food was good. I would recommend it for both Tourism and Business, you will not regret what you paying for."
561596873,VCBCX1,2/19/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"Superb place, spotless, comfortable, tremendous staff, and convenience you can't beat. You are in the heart of Burnaby, most everything is in walking distance, including the SkyTrain, which puts you in the heart of Vancouver in 15 minutes. Value for your money can't be beat."
497148889,VCBCX1,6/29/2017,Vancouver X Inn,We were in XT for five days ! Very centrally located ! Just next to metropolis mall and sky train ! Room size is good we were 4 people in one room ! But very comfortable ! Buffet breakfast is really good ' hotel has all the amenities and staff is very good and helpful! I
545888501,VCBCX1,12/7/2017,Vancouver X Inn,The XT at Metro town is an exceptional hotel with the greatest staff.  A true home away from home! The staff treat you like a friend and go out of their way to attend to your needs while there. I would highly recommend the XT at Metro town to anyone going to Burnaby.
194767470,VCBCX1,2/20/2014,Vancouver X Inn,I just love staying here! Best beds! And the best front desk service! We arrived early for meetings and were allowed early check in and also a later check out! They really accommodate me and I like that the front desk people always are smiling! It makes a big difference!
235824530,VCBCX1,10/21/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"I enjoyed delicious meals in the hotel restaurant and lounge, received excellent service from friendly staff and was impressed with the appearance and cleanliness of the entire hotel.  The room was spotless and comfortable. Great location next to shopping and transit."
332467005,VCBCX1,12/13/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"Our room on the 12th floor was very clean, bed was comfortable and loved the pillows. Would definitely recommend to others. Don't like to pay extra for parking, but seems like it is the norm in this area.Great special price for our stay and super close to Metrotown. "
471791776,VCBCX1,3/31/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"What a find! Close to great shopping, the sky train, and fast access to the highway - very central if you have to get around the lower mainland. The rooms are very well appointed and the I can't say enough about the staff. The food was very well priced and presented."
494119217,VCBCX1,6/18/2017,Vancouver X Inn,It was very welcoming coming into the hotel the staff are very friendly the restaurant was very good and they were very helpful the staff. I like tell the lady in the restaurant went over and above and gave my wife a blanket to keep her warm  and adjusted the heat. 
218146550,VCBCX1,7/28/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Had a very good stay, hotel staff is friendly and accommodations were nice and clean. Location is excellent and even though there is a lot of construction around the area, very little noise. The Skytrain was out of commission for a few hours but taxis are plentiful."
512913430,VCBCX1,8/14/2017,Vancouver X Inn,It is not value at all which u pay for per night. Even online pre checkin is not useful when you arrived we got room at 4.30 inspite of 3 o clock time. No option for vegetarians except bread and fruits and Chefs doesn't know how to cook and they will not do as well
357861932,VCBCX1,3/23/2016,Vancouver X Inn,The room was small nothing special. Hot tub was a 4 person packed while children running wild dive bombing and unsupervised in the lengths pool.  For a XT i day they could do better at this one. Considering parking id $16.00 and internets $6.95 for 3 devices. 
202469323,VCBCX1,4/23/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"From fire alarms going off all night long,to worn decor and uncaring (bordering on rude) staff, this hotel has relied on its location for too long. The convenient location no longer makes up for its glaring deficits. It's off my list for handy aces to stay."
389743853,VCBCX1,7/6/2016,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel including the elevator smells of Chinese food. The smell is in some of the linens too. Our room was not cleaned properly. Found some person items (unmentionables) left by previous guests.XT should offer unbiased service to all guests.
253632497,VCBCX1,2/10/2015,Vancouver X Inn,Very nice clean comfortable room.  The location is great and the staff is very friendly and accommodating! I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in Burnaby.  Its a bonus that it is attached to metro town as well and near sky train!
601314296,VCBCX1,7/30/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"This location was convenient to restaurants, shopping and the SkyTrain for trips to downtown. The staff provided excellent reccomedations for attractions and restaurants. The roooms were very clean and modern. I would stay at this location again"
494420859,VCBCX1,6/19/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff here were so nice and professional, yet personal. They gave us suggestions of things to do, places to visit and the best and safest ways to get there. Room was very nice, clean and quiet. Restaurant food and receptions were very nice."
372511292,VCBCX1,5/12/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Great service, great room, nice size rooms with great amenities. We enjoyed dinner with great food, wonderful waiter and breakfast was excellent! with a great waitress! Very close to Metrotown and we could not hear the road noise from our room!"
353101725,VCBCX1,3/5/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Had a wonderful stay here!  Steve at the Reflect Lounge was a blast to hang out with and Cecile was very very nice.  Accommodations are great,  the beds and pillows are wonderful! Every staff member at this hotel are very polite and helpful."
571920419,VCBCX1,4/8/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"Our toilet was broken, our heating was broken and the people who tried to fix the problems were super invasive. The beds were not very soft. I was not happy with our stay considering we thought The XT to be a night we treat ourselves. "
445430531,VCBCX1,12/19/2016,Vancouver X Inn,The gem is located across the street from metro town which made it easy for Xmas shopping. The room was very clean and bright. The buffet breakfast was $22.00 which I found very expensive especially when most of the food trays were empty. 
507494027,VCBCX1,7/31/2017,Vancouver X Inn,right in the heart of Metrotown. Comfy bed. You can hop a train to downtown easily. great if you dont want to spend $500 a night + for downtown hotel.  lots of local asian choices for food near by. also Earls was a great meal we had.
217138570,VCBCX1,7/23/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Badly on need of an update. Uncaring rude staff, great location. Overpriced and living on its reputation. Unless they make some improvements they will find their customer base dwindles.bathrooms are clean but worn. View is great."
469023095,VCBCX1,3/20/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"this hotel have good services, friendly services for our tred show s, they very good hotel to have tread shows. good bell man , and front desk ,services very clean rooms goos housekeeping  services ,  i like this hotel very much"
335875892,VCBCX1,12/29/2015,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel is very clean and located central to everything . The service and associates were very accomodating and friendly. A very nice experience. Located right accross the street from a major mall and the light rail transit.
166122797,VCBCX1,7/1/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel, clean, spacious rooms.  Very good meeting facilities.  Staff very good at their jobs, helpful and polite.  Only complaint is parking facilities not adequate for size of hotel.  Otherwise a positive experience."
541116485,VCBCX1,11/15/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent stay. The room was very clean and very much worth the price we paid for it. The staff was friendly and helpful. If I ever return to the area, I look forward to staying in this hotel again. I would highly recommend. "
503382517,VCBCX1,7/18/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"Staff friendly and helpful. Good location-easy to reach by Sky Train from airport. Nice garden to enjoy across the street next to library. Enjoyed concert in park and people watching. Convenient for eating, shopping, walking."
158791167,VCBCX1,4/21/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times over the past 10 years. The staff and managemenbt are absolutely wonderful. The hotel is extremely clean and quiet, and the beds are very comfortable. This is a great place to stay."
227836213,VCBCX1,9/8/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Close to all trains, buses and a very large shopping center. The staff are very good and the rooms are quiet and clean. Only $40 taxi from the airport. The bar and restaurant staff look after you very well. I will be back."
306460374,VCBCX1,9/2/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"The room was very comfortable. Great location close to the Skytrain, shopping and many restaurants. Their Sunday Brunch had an amazing selection with crab, claims and prawns. The staff was courteous and very professional."
198761928,VCBCX1,3/23/2014,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel never disappoints.  The location is great really close to Skytrain and a large shopping mall. The staff is wonderful.  Super friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable.
465640615,VCBCX1,3/8/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is always a pleasure. Check in fast and easy. Friendly staff.   The odd time the room has minor issues, more things I am sure have never been reported to maintenance. Reasonable close to the shopping center."
606875294,VCBCX1,8/15/2018,Vancouver X Inn,Receptionist are not paying attention and everything went wrong! I called i email i never got any response. Do try to find a better place to stay if you have a plan to visit vancouverDo not stay in this property
464818172,VCBCX1,3/5/2017,Vancouver X Inn,I'm a local but have been at many conventions here and have stayed on other occasions. Service is first class and staff have a can do attitude- highly recommended for large groups or just on your own or couples
576531930,VCBCX1,4/29/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"right next door to Metrotown mall - very hardworking staff who make you feel welcome. good cappuccino! reasonable breakfast. good quality fish on menu. fast, reliable internet. only 30 minutes from the airport"
161292423,VCBCX1,5/15/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"extremely substandard beds and pillows, super  stinky lobby no free wi fi expensive for everything at hotel........................... I would never stay here again the location was very close to the mall"
354482480,VCBCX1,3/10/2016,Vancouver X Inn,Very nice overall but not the greatest location.  We would recommend to others that need to be in that general area but would probably not stay here again unless we needed to be in that particular place.
532894759,VCBCX1,10/14/2017,Vancouver X Inn,XT Diamond Member here. To travellers reading this: the only reason why I would write that in the first line is because these reviews wouldn&#39;t be read by the hotel otherwise.
358768008,VCBCX1,3/26/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"This location is great for shopping and is only a few minute walk from the sky train station. The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. The hotel is set up weird and it hard to find the small outdoor pool. There is a great Asian style mall/food court attached to the hotel and all though this is convenient, it also brings the smell into the whole hotel.  Better prices that downtown Vancouver and a 15-20 min sky train ride that cost about $3 will get you into the heart of downtown. "
181438500,VCBCX1,10/17/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel was good and a hop away from shopping the Metro mall but room service is not 24 hrs. When I am out and about it would be nice to have a list of pizza or pasta places that deliver to the hotel especially if I drove by one on the way down. I guess I shouldn't assume that the hotel would know better than what I have saw. Next time I'll do more research as who offers those midnight snack. Could of been worse I'm sure I saved a few midnight calories, lol."
184982516,VCBCX1,11/17/2013,Vancouver X Inn,Just completed 3 night stay.  Great accommodation very close to Skytrain and the access to downtown that it provides.  Great service in the Restaurant and Bar.  Special mention to Jonathan made the last night very entertaining.  Retail mall just across the street make it a great location.
447982843,VCBCX1,12/30/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Although it was only for one night, our stay was a pleasant one. Wish I stayed longer as I heard there was a casino just minutes away and a huge mall which we did go to. Plus there was a Chinese shopping mall next door. Walked through it and wish I walked around more but time was limited."
347043822,VCBCX1,2/11/2016,Vancouver X Inn,Very close to skytrain Doesn't include a bottle of water Bathroom doors open outwards like a closet Higher up is better to not hear the skytrain Use the XTHonors phone app (makes it easier) Internet is only 1MB throughput unless you pay for premium Shopping mall is very close by (for anything forgotten at home) Starbucks is 1 block away.
345710266,VCBCX1,2/7/2016,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed at the XT Vancouver Metrotown several times over the past 10 years for both business and pleasure.    My wife and I stayed again this past weekend and it was just as good as always.   I've stayed in hotels in many spots around the world and have found no better staff than at the XT Vancouver Metrotown.  Everyone is friendly and very attentive.  They make eye contact and make you feel welcome.  We had a one bedroom suite that was excellent.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and reasonably priced.  This is a great hotel on all fronts.
275662764,VCBCX1,5/29/2015,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is a great choice for anyone wanting easy access to downtown Vancouver but without downtown prices.  It's a easy drive or cab in to downtown Vancouver or Skytrain transit is a block away.   The hotel was clean and quiet --it's also across the street from Metrotown Shopping Mall (including grocery stores) for ease of picking up anything you might need while travelling.
251695863,VCBCX1,1/29/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"The room is clean, quite large and the personnel is always at your disposal, particularly at reception area. The restaurant is not a great quality, the service is long and not at level of the brand, the dishes that I tried was not particular taste nor really inviting while the wine was nice. If you wish to eat better than go downtown it is to be preferred."
459902565,VCBCX1,2/14/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"Very happy with staff and overall quality of the stay.  Very clean and great location for travelling through out the city.  Shuttle service and ( Joe) makes it easy for travellers who are unfamiliar with the area.   The lounge is a great place to relax after a work day or a great place for a social gathering.  Would definitely recommend this  hotel to family, singles and all business travellers.   The Sky train and Metro Mall are all   within walking distance so there is always something to do."
185262538,VCBCX1,11/19/2013,Vancouver X Inn,My favourite place to stay when in town on business. The staff treats you like a valued customer.  Service is excellent and rooms are beautiful. Parking garage is a bit dicey but not enough of an issue to make me stay somewhere else! Great breakfast buffet and the bar is a nice place to chill with a drink after work.
349028967,VCBCX1,2/18/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Good, standard XT. Nice location to Metrotown and Skytrain, super easy to zip into downtown Vancouver. Self-park underground was reasonable at $21 but the $50 per night pet fee I thought was completely ridiculous. Bland lounge, bland food but there are tons of dining options within a block or two. Again, without the pet fee you can't beat the location for a shopping trip."
304726510,VCBCX1,8/29/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here one night just passing through.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was great, which included menu items or a buffet.  Buffet was well stocked, hot and cold, fresh fruit and pastries.  You could eat outside on the balcony or in the main room.  Location was nice to walk to little shops or to have a drink."
222805777,VCBCX1,8/18/2014,Vancouver X Inn,It is a relatively new facility. The room was well appointed and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived late and left early so we were not able to experience any the amenities. I would stay in this facility again.
585660223,VCBCX1,6/6/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"I would not recommend this hotel for a pleasure trip. Staff was not very friendly and the hotel caters to business trips. The restaurant on site was good but very expensive. Construction and bad city views of Vancouver. There wasnâ€™t much to do close by and not many restaurants. Fortunately for us, this was just a stay over until our flights the next morning. Not a good hotel."
629273168,VCBCX1,10/28/2018,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed at this hotel for an event that was hosted there. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Complimentary WiFi was amazing. Very close to major shopping centre and train station. I was with a small group and we did a tour of the Rockies following our stay here and XT stored our excess luggage for a week following checkout without any problems. The collection process was so easy and the valets were very helpful in packing our car up again for us! 
590742986,VCBCX1,6/25/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"Rooms were clean, the food was great and the staff was awesome !! The location was close to some very good restaurants and the Metroline was within walking distance. The mall was close to the hotel and it was just a good stay. "
164417717,VCBCX1,6/18/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed here for one night at the tail end of a long business trip.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I got an upgrade to a suite which was in good condition and I liked the decor - light and airy.  The executive lounge was the best out of the one's I stayed at on this work run though it still doesn't even come close to comparing to the XT in Bangkok.  They have a nice balcony area with a single lane lap pool which was great for a cool morning swim as it was heated.  The gym is pretty dark and small.  Is it the best XT, no.  Is it the worst, far from it though the price seems steep (though all hotels in Canada seem expensive for what they are)."
586921106,VCBCX1,6/12/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel isn't bad, nice location. Staff is nice but the rooms feel like they're missing something. It's the same story with the breakfast buffet and the pool, almost made it but just missed. They charge gold members for hot breakfast and the pool is a joke, I don't even know why they built it. Parking is $16 a day in a somewhat confusing garage. On the plus side the lounge is a nice place to relax, have a drink and watch the game. Will probably stay again because the number of XT properties within the area and affordability is limited."
322008857,VCBCX1,10/26/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"Fine hotel, bit of a way into the city, but easy 20 min drive and public transport available just outside the door.Received upgrade to a suite as HHonors member, and also access to Executive Lounge. Lounge is nothing special but access appreciated. Evening snacks, 2 warm and also salad items and filled rolls. Free soft drinks and Honor bar for alcohol. Staff attentive."
284535449,VCBCX1,6/30/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"Charming staff, comfortable rooms. Very clean, modern, and cozy. The location by the park and close to the Skytrain makes this place a &quot;must stay&quot;. We met friends there and everyone agree this was a great value."
374722944,VCBCX1,5/19/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Enjoyed our stay! Exit cruise ship Coral Princess, we ventured off from Downtown Waterfront, Vancouver, walked with our bags to board the SkyTrain where we met family members from Seattle, WA to Metrotown XT which for us was within walking distance from SkyTrain."
505995315,VCBCX1,7/26/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel offered modern rooms that were spacious, clean and comfortable for our family of 4. Staff was the best part. They were friendly and helpful often going above and beyond the level of service you would expect. Continental Breakfast was included and for a very small amount, you could upgrade to an awesome hot breakfast. Lots to choose from and full service dining room. Highly recommend this hotel. "
546709746,VCBCX1,12/11/2017,Vancouver X Inn,If your looking for a room to just stay at and do your own thing out and not spend your whole time in the room this would be it. Although I think they charge way too much for a motel size room and the quality is not something I would see in a XT property Iâ€™ve seen and stayed at many XTâ€™s and not once have I seen it this crappy!
371725306,VCBCX1,5/10/2016,Vancouver X Inn,Loved our stay here.  The hotel is beautiful.  We had a one bedroom suite on the 15th floor and the views were incredible.  The bed was extremely comfortable-loved the feel of the bedding.  Definitely plan to stay here next time I'm in Vancouver!
492355624,VCBCX1,6/11/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"My reservation was for an upper floor King Suite. I was placed on the 11th floor of the 18 floor hotel and advised that all upper floor rooms were taken. After gathering the luggage cart and my luggage in front of the bellman, he followed me to the elevator and then asked if I needed assistance???  I arrived in my room to find the soiled bathroom. I called the front desk and informed them of the bathroom condition and requested to be relocated. I returned to the front desk and spoke with the manager who acknowledged the room's condition and offered me a choice of a room on the 16th or 18th floor. I was obviously struck by the new found upper floor room availability??? Bottom line, the weekday staff was considerably more professional and supportive and this hotel is in desperate need of maintenance, upgrades, replacement of furnishings, and staff training."
178555773,VCBCX1,9/25/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"A last minute trip to Vancouver left us with only a few reasonably priced business hotels.  This XT is clean, safe, affordable with a charming staff.  There is a huge mall across the street with many shops and a few decent restaurants.  But...there are no really good places to eat in the hotel or anywhere within walking distance.  You are in the suburbs for sure at this hotel.  So, if you want a decent place to meet for dinner you will need to take the 20 minute drive into downtown Vancouver.  If your work is on the east side of Vancouver or in Burnaby then it is hard to beat the convenience of this property.  All in...not too bad."
167595486,VCBCX1,7/14/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel. Good location on outskirts of Vancouver. Good access to downtown Vancouver and nearby sites. Friendly, competent professional staff. Enjoyed our stay immensely. Would return in the future for business or pleasure."
274303441,VCBCX1,5/24/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel last week, as I went to an event at the Vancouver Convention Center. First, this hotel is in Burbany, 30 minutes from my event by car. There is plenty of option to get to Vancouver, including a convenient train.The hotel is in the middle of a Chinatown, with lots of signs and stores in Chinese.The room itself is good, like you would expect of a XT hotel.Overall, good experience"
218329753,VCBCX1,7/29/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband and I had never travelled to Vancouver and did not completely understand how far away this hotel would be from Downtown Vancouver.  This hotel is old and needs some updating but our room was decent and clean. The staff members were very helpful and friendly.  They explained how we could get around Vancouver using the city transit system. What a fun experience - we went on the metro rail system, the sea bus and city bus. The hotel is located within a few blocks of the second largest mall in Canada and it was huge. Overall we had a good experience."
404256424,VCBCX1,8/11/2016,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel is actually in the city of Burnaby which is east of Vancouver.  The area itself is nice enough and all the buildings seem modern.  It's close to a couple of parks including Central Park. Metrotown Mall and the train station is about a 5 to 7 min. walk.  There are some restaurants in the area that are walking distance.  The hotel is right next to Crystal Mall and there's an Asian food court that's connected to the lobby via the 2nd floor.  The train ride to downtown Vancouver is about 20 min. The service from my experience was good.  The room was clean and spacious.  I would stay here again.
312881825,VCBCX1,9/22/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is convenient for the sky train (about 5 minutes walk) but if you are doing all the tourist stuff then down by the waterfront or Vancouver centre are to be recommended. we had breakfast one morning and it was very poor but not cheap so unless you get a deal with breakfast, go elsewhere.The bar service for food and drink was ok but can be very cold so dress up, but there are a few decent restaurants nearby which are quite worth a visit.The gym is old and needs a refurbishment (concept 2 rower must be 20 years old, model b, and is very tired) and more in keeping of third world hotels. I didn't try the outdoor pool."
303017359,VCBCX1,8/24/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"We chose the XT Metrotown in part because of the somewhat lower prices than similar properties in the main downtown areas of Vancouver. It's in the suburb of Burnaby, around 20 to 30 minutes from downtown depending on traffic and where you're going.Overall we liked the property. We had a car (parking is $11 Cdn self-park or $15 valet), but it isn't far from the SkyTrain that will take you to downtown Vancouver. The hotel is at Metrotown, a large mall and entertainment center, if you're into shopping. You should know, however, that there construction going on directly across from the hotel. A Best Buy and some other big store have just broken ground, so this could be a minor convenience over the next few months.For Gold and Diamond XT Honors members, there's an included continental breakfast and free wi-fi."
566332133,VCBCX1,3/13/2018,Vancouver X Inn,Hotel was close to metro to easily reach downtown and next to a large shopping mall. Hotel was well appointed with a parking garage underneath and good breakfast to kick start the day. Room was spacious and well equipped. would return when back in Vancouver!
482192279,VCBCX1,5/6/2017,Vancouver X Inn,This property is not new. It is at least 20 years old I would guesstimate. The layout and floorplan are clearly dated though there has been some effort made to maintain the property and ensure that the furnishings carpets etc. were in good condition.  The service was very average. The staff were superficially friendly and I had no major issues during my stay. The property could desperately do with some updating however the location around it makes up for some of this.  Next time I visit Vancouver I will definitely not return here  as there are several newer properties in that same neighborhood.
374989595,VCBCX1,5/20/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"After reading the review about foulSmells and viral outbreak, I was very hesitant to stay here. But I'm very glad we did. The hotel was clean, efficient and friendly. We were on the executive floor and had access to the opal lounge - free soft drinks and snacks, breakfast and appetizers - which we used for a light dinner. The attendant was excellent and the food was good. Our room had a lovely view and we were in walking distance of a large mall - a fun spot for after dinner walking. A great place to stay in Vancouver !"
585324737,VCBCX1,6/5/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"great location: close to the metro (sky train) for easy access to downtown or any corner of the city...  the service is really good, specially the room attendants who go the extra mile to leave you room spotless and even organize the kids toys in a way we all got a smile when arriving back in the room.  The restaurants around the hotel are very good, and the hotel restaurant is really good for breakfast... getting the menu is sometimes better than getting the buffet.  best bang for your buck!!"
530015409,VCBCX1,10/4/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"It is a quick, 5 min walk from the hotel to the Skytrain Metrotown station, and from there it is a 15 minute train ride to downtown.Hotel is nice, with a peek at the mountains but the view is becoming obscured by the many hi-rise buildings being built around it.  Many dining options nearby.We never made it to the rooftop pool - which we now really regret!Overall, a good hotel choice for those like us who wanted a nice hotel but who couldn't justify the very high downtown rates."
177380855,VCBCX1,9/16/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"Ideally, we would have stayed downtown, but this was a great value.  Glad we did, the sky train is next to the hotel and the drive into downtown Vancouver is not bad when traffic is moving.  The hotel is in good shape, our room was a little small, but clean and well-appointed.  Lot of places to eat close by, you can walk to a lot of places nearby if you wish.  If you can't stay downtown Vancouver due to high rates, this is a good alternative."
642060144,VCBCX1,12/28/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"Wouldnâ€™t have been my top choice in Vancouver, but hotels are expensive and this one was reasonably priced. The parking deck is tight and expensive, but we made it work. The beds were comfy and the bathrooms were clean. We had breakfast included and the spread was pretty good. Overall, a good hotel, but I wish it was in a better location."
501174425,VCBCX1,7/12/2017,Vancouver X Inn,What a beautiful city went to Stanley ParkAte at Earls great vegan meal and great wineThe pool at the hotel was a great work out even went on the open deck and workedWalking distance to the largest mallGrocery shopping got some local food while I was staying in town
314923874,VCBCX1,9/29/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a first class facility - modern, clean, outstanding service.  Close to public transportation which can get you anywhere in Vancouver very easily.  The service from the front door through every part of the hotel was just outstanding.  Just a note....the area around the hotel is a little seedy in some areas - adult book stores, tattoo parlors, but that does not take away from the service in the hotel."
288299714,VCBCX1,7/12/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"I traveled to beautiful Vancouver last week on business and stayed at the XT Metrotown. It was a nice hotel, located central to many sites, although not downtown. The sky train is a 2 block walk from the hotel, and a 20 min ride from the downtown attractions. The hotel is attached to the Crystal Mall (an Asian shopping mall with every type of Asian cuisine or item you can ask for) and can be accessed from an escalator in the XT lobby. Free parking for hotel guests under the XT is shared with mall dwellers, but hotel guests park in blue areas. Walking distances to other restaurant choices. Nice hotel, I will be back when I return to Vancouver."
490790810,VCBCX1,6/5/2017,Vancouver X Inn,Staying here was a wonderful experience! The staff was extremely helpful to me as I was traveling internationally.  Great location near many good restaurants and close to the Aquabus stop for a quick ride to Granville Island. Wonderfully comfortable rooms.I would stay here again and again!
552567224,VCBCX1,1/8/2018,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel was great for our stay. Lovely staff always happy to help and very pleasant. We stayed over the New Year and although there was a huge celebration we were not disturbed and the staff stayed professional and polite.  Very good experience with this hotel. 
292059725,VCBCX1,7/24/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here pre cruise and highly recommend the place.The hotel is impressive in all a aspects with very comfortable beds, large rooms, quiet and the service is outstanding. We had a 100% strike rate with all staff members, very friendly, welcoming and go the extra yard to help, nothing was a problem.The train is close to take you to the cruise terminal.There is a mall closeby and food outlets next door.Next time we are in Vancouver we wouldn't hesitate staying again. "
638563462,VCBCX1,12/10/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is very well located and so central to everything. I stayed here and shopped right across the street at the Metropolis Mall.Take a long weekender rate, its their best option. Lots of options available to eat on Kingsway."
580000078,VCBCX1,5/13/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"A great location.  7 stops to Chinatown which is all that matters to me while in Vanc, but why go to Chinatown when Burnaby is AMAZING for Chinese cuisine, markets, and yum. The hotel is great... quiet, very clean, well managed, and generous with square feet mimicking glass walled Vancouver. Breakfast on the third floor, workout on the second, or lumber along two blocks to the Metrotown stop.  A bit sterile, the entranceway doesnâ€™t portend well the rooms homey comfort and design.  I do wish they gave fruit and or coffee/ tea choices for guests near the concierge.  A great bonus is the building is built next to a great market with everything soups to nuts, and prepared foods.  Hang out.  People watch.  Learn to make a dumpling... worthy of the people of Vancouver.  "
213132272,VCBCX1,7/1/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Overall the hotel isn't too bad.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are immaculately clean.  The real downside was the food, which in a word was terrible.  Granted we had buffet food several times, but even by buffet standards it was less than adequate."
461551833,VCBCX1,2/20/2017,Vancouver X Inn,Metrotown service was good. The staff were very courteous and helpful. If you needed anything they were there to see what they could do to help. The cleaning staff were very polite . Most of all front of the house were excellent 
626138513,VCBCX1,10/18/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"On check in, the person checking us in was very friendly and very helpful. He took the time to upgrade us on our stay where he could (Diamond Member).The hotel in general is quiet and clean and is situated to close to may amenities, on the large part due to Metrotown mall being 1/2 block away. The rooms were clean and comfortable as always. The room service, although slow, was also good, the person who came to deliver our food was quite friendly."
367619138,VCBCX1,4/25/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel, quiet room on an upper floor. Loved staying here away from the bustle of downtown Vancouver but handy to everything as long as you have a car - reasonable price for parking. Bathroom spacious and all well equipped. Would be good to have real milk for coffee instead of powered junk. "
152547135,VCBCX1,2/19/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed one night with our dog. There was a package in the room for the dog with a bed, bowls and mat. A very pet friendly hotel and made us know it was more then alright that we did have a dog with us and that it was okay for her to be in the lobby etc. All the staff we had interactions with were the most friendly, kind people. Super impressed with the level of service. We did order room service for dinner and it was great! Would stay here again in a heart beat."
336108635,VCBCX1,12/30/2015,Vancouver X Inn,There is nothing in the world that the staff does not do for you. I have stayed in many hotels in usa but the service you get in Vancouver XT is phenomenal.  I got breakfast and evening snacks. It is so much . The pastry cakes are so nice . Thank you XT metro town. Very close to sky train . This skytrain will take you to all major places in Vancouver.  Will go back. 
182307834,VCBCX1,10/24/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel has the best customer service I have ever experienced.  They were respectful, responsive and very helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in the area.  You won't be disappointed."
290116162,VCBCX1,7/18/2015,Vancouver X Inn,Great hotel - rooms fabulous. Beds soooo comfy. Great views over city.  Short walk to sky train.  A bit of luxury during a touring holiday.A few pointers - not enough signage around the hotel to find where you are.  No signs in lift - difficult to get room key into lift selection floor - pool far too small for a hotel this size and also very difficult to find.Staff very friendly and helpful especially the lovely lady in executive lounge in an evening.
179664219,VCBCX1,10/3/2013,Vancouver X Inn,"What can I say?  The XT at Metrotown blew my expectations away.  From the booking process to the chocolate covered strawberries in the fridge and rose petals strewn about the room, The XT Metrotown made our wedding night a very memorable and relaxing experience.  I would strongly recommend this hotel."
278796223,VCBCX1,6/8/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"We had a day's notice that the family was have a quick reunion in Vancouver at my sister's home. We needed a room night quickly and the XT was available. We stayed here last January and was greeted and given excellent service from the Front Desk, Concierge, Bellhop and the room service!! Great Breakfast buffet! I recommend this place!"
552587402,VCBCX1,1/8/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"We stay here overnight to go to a Canucks game, we were able to check-in early, walk around the area (including the nearby mall) and grab beverages in the Executive Lounge.  As Diamond members we also had access to a light dinner and full breakfast buffet.  The Skytrain was just a five-minute walk which we took to the hockey game: a cheap and efficient mode of travel. Staff were excellent and the early check-in was much appreciated.  Last but not least, our room had a great view of the nearby mountains."
392737274,VCBCX1,7/14/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"For a high priced hotel I was disappointed.  Interactions with many of the hotel staff were off-putting.  Many need to be trained or re-trained in customer relations:  the room service waiter who asked me to do him a favor, the glacial front desk clerk, the mediocre food, the constant emails exhorting me to spend more and more money.  Generally the staff was timely except when i tried to do quick check-out over the phone and  gave up after several minutes when no on came on the line.  I did like getting a room number in advance.  But overall a disappointing experience for a high priced hotel in a so-so location.."
463383512,VCBCX1,2/27/2017,Vancouver X Inn,We recently stayed at this property and were happy with our overall experience.  I would recommend staying here for personal or business.  The room was comfortable and clean overall.  Not new - but maintained.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.
348753677,VCBCX1,2/17/2016,Vancouver X Inn,The staff of this hotel was excellent. The hotel was clean and well cared for. They went over and beyond any expectation we had. They were accommodating and were actively looking to make our stay the most enjoyable possible.  We will definitely stay there again.
194568804,VCBCX1,2/18/2014,Vancouver X Inn,Stayed here for four nights.  It was a quite hotel and very clean.  Staff was very helpful...They offered a shuttle service to and back where I had to report for a workshop...  Situated 5min walk from the Mall and SkyTrain.
239602735,VCBCX1,11/12/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent stay, with close proximity to shopping and conference site.  The room was comfortable and clean and offered for an enjoyable stay.  Buffet breakfast was a great addition with lots of options to choose from with fresh fruits and a mixture of hot dishes.  Would look at staying at this hotel again if the opportunity arose."
390256262,VCBCX1,7/7/2016,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel was a great location for getting the feel of living in the Vancouver area and using the train railway downtown or to wherever! This XT is right across from a big Shopping Mall and train!
420174834,VCBCX1,9/19/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed at XT Metrotown for a four day break. Ideal location for the train station to downtown Vancouver, 20 min ride, and also for the Metropolis Mall (400 shops and food stalls). Hotel room was quiet but pick the higher number rooms and the highest number you can get on the floor as the ice machine is close to the lower numbered rooms and is quite noisy.  The staff were keen to meet the needs of everyone, booking taxis, lending umbrellas, pointing out places to go, accommodating food requirements. Shusheel Prem was the perfect host and managed the arrival of about 50 guests, for an unexpected breakfast, with politeness and efficiency.  Only downside is the access to complimentary wifi which was very limited and would not support more than two mins without logging off. However, this was a minor point as we were on holiday.  A great stay."
249359763,VCBCX1,1/14/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"We have stayed here over Christmas the last couple of years visiting family and it has worked really well for us.  The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from Metrotown which is really convenient, and the amenities and service are very good.  The rooms are spacious and well laid out, the onsite food options are good, although a touch pricey.  Being HH Gold, the Executive lounge on the 18th floor is a nice touch and the views over downtown Vancouver are fantastic.  The prices are pretty reasonable for a big city as well, although we generally use points accumulated over the year."
437606099,VCBCX1,11/15/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"A great weekend of relaxation, shopping and eating.  The Asian market place (Crystal Mall) is a great place to grab a quick bite and shop for out of the ordinary items.  We love the Mall that is close by (Hudson Bay Company) -- "
622982837,VCBCX1,10/7/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed in this hotel during a work trip, the staff was very nice and the room was large and very clean. The location was not particularly beautiful, but convenient to get to the train station. There are a couple of malls near by."
242332009,VCBCX1,12/1/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is right by Metro town and also the Sky Train.We were there for Grey Cup week-end, so the hotel was full of football fans, which added to the experience.  The staff was great. Under ground parking was only $11., which was very reasonable. The Lounge served wonderful food.Great place to stay for a couple of nights."
381778385,VCBCX1,6/11/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Staff are always friendly and helpful.  The hotel is located close to shopping, restaurants and public transportation.  You can walk to hundreds of shops easily, or take the skytrain to other attractions. Rooms are very clean and quiet."
586207944,VCBCX1,6/9/2018,Vancouver X Inn,The Metrotown XT is just a quick 15 ride or less to downtown Vancouver on the last hhtvrsilbwhichbid a half block away. Itâ€™s an excellent facility with a large mall almost across the street and a large beautiful park right next door. Very nice neighborhood. Lots of restaurants for dinner choices as well. Great facility with great staff. 
447274967,VCBCX1,12/28/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"A family friendly hotel with breath taking views and excellent food service. The suites are excellent choice if one is travelling with kids/teenagers. The location to major shopping areas and highway is a plus. Overall a very satisfying stay. The staff, Morekta, Arif, Raj and Leah all helped us making this trip memorable."
374113031,VCBCX1,5/18/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is conveniently located to many of Vancouver' Eastern suburbs.There are some very good Chinese Restaurants in the area as well.The staff are friendly and very helpful.The view from the room was beautiful.My issues with this location is that at the $200 per night price range it is not quite &quot;there&quot;.The room was ice cold not matter what we set the heat to.  We had it set to 83f /28c and we froze.The bathroom, while attractive, had no water pressure and the tub/shower fixtures felt like they were going to pull off the wall.Over all a good hotel for business, yet priced a bit high. I would not reccomend it at all for families or a pleasure trip."
255119877,VCBCX1,2/18/2015,Vancouver X Inn,I travel half of my life for work. This stay happened to be for a little family vacation. The hotel is nice. The room we ordered was actually larger than expected. The images on the website were not very helpful in this regard so a pleasant surprise. I will say that for a XT it was probably one of the worst beds I have ever slept on. I woke up every morning with a sore lower back. The service was as expected from a XT.
281024091,VCBCX1,6/17/2015,Vancouver X Inn,Just finished two great nights here. We were looking for a place to stay for the World Cup. The XT was reasonably priced and had king size suites that accommodated our family. The rooms were nice clean and spacious. Easy access to the Skytrain and two blocks from one of the largest malls that I have ever seen. I travel 2-3 times a month and I will say this hotel had the nicest most accommodating staff that I have ever experienced. When we arrived we needed a roll-a-way bed and once the gentleman from housekeeping brought it and saw our large family he went back and got us extra towels and toiletries without us even asking. The host/restaurant manager and the servers were spectacular as well as the front desk and bell service. There was a consistency from everyone that you rarely see these days. A job well done!  I would highly reccomend the XT!
195522028,VCBCX1,2/26/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"Very pleasant facility with excellent access to  restaurants and transit.  B.C.'s largest shopping mall is right across the street, with access to the Skytrain. The rooms are very quiet, comfortable and standards of cleanliness are very high.  All staff are extremely courteous."
371072506,VCBCX1,5/7/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Over-all, a comfortable peaceful stay.  Service everywhere from housekeeping to their Reflect restaurant to the front desk was prompt, cheerful and very helpful.  Shopping in the Metrotown complex, a 5-minute walk away. Same with the SkyTrain.  A good sized room with a luxurious, firm, king bed.  Predominantly urban downtown view from our 12th floor full wall window with a teaser view of Mt. Baker in the distance on clear days. Choose other than a &quot;corner&quot; room if a smaller bathroom would be a problem. Buffet breakfast was a tad pricey at total $23 per person with lots of fruit choices, pastry, egg, potato and perfect bacon.  Give it a go... we're glad we did!"
540683279,VCBCX1,11/13/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"XT Vancouver Metrotown is convenient and clean.  The hotel is convenient to restaurants, the Mall and business in the city.  I love the view of the mountains and the onsite bar/restaurant.  They have a nice XT Honors club on the 18th floor with tasty foods and treats.ConsumerMarineSupply"
220087563,VCBCX1,8/6/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"This property is conveniently located near (5 mins walk) to Metropolis at Metrotown Mall, and the Sky Train, it is also attached to a quaint Asian mall called the Crystal Mall which offers a wide selection of oriental cuisine. There are also a number of places of worship nearby or easily accessed via the Transit. The rooms are up to the usual high XT standard, and the Hotel was quite accommodating to travelers with late evening flights, allowing us to stay well pass the normal noon check out, we were also allowed to check-in to our room early (9:30AM). The on-premises restaurant Reflect is also a plus, and the staff friendly.Stayed post cruise for 2 days."
192280852,VCBCX1,1/27/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed for 2 nights with a room on the executive floor. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is well located for both metro town and the sky train. The room was immaculately clean, the bed was large and comfy but the bathroom was tiny and the view from the window was a building site. The nibbles in the executive room early evening was delicious but the breakfast was not up to much just the basic items.They did give us a very late check out as they were not busy but as gold members even though they weren't busy we didn't get a room upgrade."
449878690,VCBCX1,1/6/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice comfortable rooms with easy access to the shopping centre. Disappointing things are they do not have proper Tea making facility, which for a none coffee drinker is disappointing. Also the shower rose is too low in the bathroom once you set into the bath, it may be fine for smaller people but for somebody 6 foot and above it is difficult to get your head under the water especially if you want to warm up.The staff were very friendly, as expected.The rooms was clean and well stocked as expected.We would stay again if we are needing a place to stay without being in the downtown area."
214717603,VCBCX1,7/10/2014,Vancouver X Inn,There were great staff when we checked in and welcomed us and were very knowledgeable. Our room was a good size with all the amenities. It was on a good level too. The bed was good but the pillows were too soft for us. The parking was paid Parking but you can go in anytime. It was very close to a shopping mall and a Chinese shopping street.
251601386,VCBCX1,1/29/2015,Vancouver X Inn,"Clean, warm, comfortable and friendly staff - yes! But surely a 4 star hotel shouldn't need to charge for wi-fi and at their very expensive prices I would have expected breakfast to have been included (if it was, we were not told!!!)."
427255602,VCBCX1,10/11/2016,Vancouver X Inn,I was fortunate enough to be at a 2 day conference at this XT so my face was a familiar one to the staff during our stay.  I also conveniently wore a name tag for the convention and found that the staff were kind enough to use my name while looking for ways to engage in conversation (from the catering crew to the janitorial staff).  The food was great and the facility was super clean.  3 cheers to you all for the great overall experience!
213694415,VCBCX1,7/4/2014,Vancouver X Inn,I had booked a room for 4 people (my 3 daughters and I) and had booked 2 Queen beds. When I checked in they wanted to give me 1 king bed. That was straightened out while we went shopping at Metrotown. The room was clean but only 3 towels for 4 people.  I phoned the front desk to ask what the wifi password was - I was informed that wifi was an extra $8.00 per night. I am actually quite shocked at this - I have stayed in many hotels and haven't been charged for wifi in years. Seemed like another cash grab in an already pricey hotel. It's back to the Coast Plaza for us!
200412003,VCBCX1,4/8/2014,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed for meetings.  The staff was pleasant and helpful and did a great job at serving food to a large group in a short time.  The food was quite good for the circumstances.  The rooms are a little tired - worn upholstery and carpet - but are clean and comfortable.  The king suite had a small fridge and wired internet connection.  The queen rooms should also include fridges for the price and there should be free wifi in the rooms.  The buffet breakfast was nice but overpriced.  Location is convenient to Metrotown and the sky train.
415765131,VCBCX1,9/7/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"We have stayed here several times over the years and are always happy to come. The hotel is typical XT but the friendly staff, free newspapers, nice exercise room and location always add to the experience. The valet parking is cheap at $19 and the bell boys/ valet are a credit to the hotel. I have mentioned on several previous hotel reviews that you only get one chance to make a first impression and our arrival/ check in was exemplary. The rooms are spacious, clean and equipped with coffee makers."
219939852,VCBCX1,8/5/2014,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a great hotel to stay at.  Clean rooms, friendly staff, and close to the skytrain.  Also within walking distance of Metrotown.  I have stayed at this hotel several times while in the Lower Mainland and never leave disapointed.  Considering the price of a room, they could offer free WiFi and cut the customer a break on parking, which is 11.00 a night."
342410896,VCBCX1,1/24/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"As far as large chain hotels go, the XT Vancouver Metrotown serves its purpose well. The room was modest but very comfortable and impeccably clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the meeting services worked well. I would definitely return for business but read my review on the Reflect restaurant at the hotel. "
245188651,VCBCX1,12/19/2014,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed at the XT many times over the years and have never been disappointed. The comfort of the beds and elegance of the rooms make all the difference. Professionalism and accommodation of the staff never fails to amaze me. Love the restaurant and menu. This Hotel is first class in every respect.
345096154,VCBCX1,2/4/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice rooms with comfortable beds. Coffee maker in the room. Lots of bathroom amenities. My wife and I stayed on a business trip and they upgraded us to a suite. The room was huge. Parking is extra (self-park or valet available), but that is par for the course in the Vancouver area. Reasonably priced."
378884313,VCBCX1,6/1/2016,Vancouver X Inn,The XT name is everything.
416510298,VCBCX1,9/9/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Six of us stayed the night prior to a Celebrity cruise. Love the location and hotel.Tansportation from the airport is by taxi or other local means only and although we read online the hotel had a shuttle to the terminal, this turned out not to be the case. Flat rate $35 downtown.Hotel check-in and staff were excellent! The lounge and restaurant was perfect. A nice variety of local craft beers, solid and delicious food and fun!There are a variety of shops and restaurants nearby including a Starbucks in the small mall across the street.Thanks, XT!"
344421989,VCBCX1,2/1/2016,Vancouver X Inn,"Not my first stay in this hotel, but as my XT status changed at start 2016, i booked back this hotel with the advantage being very close to a customer for business reason.Even i had never complaints in the past, this time i could enjoy the lounge access and an upgraded room (2rooms concept, 1 with bed other room more sitting TV room). Choice of food and drinks in lounge was impressive.Of course, i also realize that these options are not for everybody but in all these hotel programs and lounge possibilities, this one is great.In addtion to say that room accomodation and bedcomfort are 100% ok, and staff very friendly.Maybe a bit far for vancouver city centre, although you have the skyline, and in close neighborhood plenty of shopping places."
489782935,VCBCX1,6/2/2017,Vancouver X Inn,"We had a normal suite in this hotel which was a very nice room. Bedroom seperated from the living room helped us survive the 9 hour jetlag (my wife could continue sleeping while I was restless during middle of the night).The hotel is very close to the very big mall metrotown and downtown Vancouver is easily reachable with the skytrain. The station of the skytrain is about 300 meters from the hotel.Lobby personnel and breakfast people extremely friendly. Also the executive lounge was a very nice feature to have.Rooms are very good sound proofed and totally no wear and tear has been found in our room.We used this hotel as a prÃ© cruise stay (cruise terminal in Vancouver is a disaster, worst we have ever travelled from) and were very happy with this hotel. If you take daytours most companies come to find you in your hotel, also in Burnaby, so no issue it's not downtown."
600057604,VCBCX1,7/26/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT hotel is located in Metrotown some 20 min by Skytrain from Downtown Vancouver. It has a big shopping mall next to it. The building is not new but the rooms are in very good condition, WiFi is excellent, staff is very friendly, breakfast not so specialAcross the street from the hotel is a big skyscraper construction site, so expect some noise from 8 AM - 4 PM"
626457669,VCBCX1,10/19/2018,Vancouver X Inn,"My wife and I stay at XTs all around the world that have an executive lounge. This hotel is located in the Chinese community area of Burnaby, but has easy skytrain access within a 5 minute walk to the Waterfront area in Vancouver where you can visit all the main attractions. The hotel is excellent despite having to be moved from our noisy bedroom due to a family with kids next door and construction outside. However, Arif on the Reception desk duly resolved the issue and also gave us full access to having breakfast in their main restaurant as well as the Executive lounge, where Suman gave us excellent service."
548231948,VCBCX1,12/20/2017,Vancouver X Inn,The staff here is wonderful. Everyone remembers your name. The location is close to shopping and the metro to take to downtown in minutes. They have a great bar and restaurant with excellent food.  We had a lovely view from our room up on the 16th floor. The room was very clean with a very comfortable bed. We will definitely stay here again when in town.
